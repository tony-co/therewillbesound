        <content type="html" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[<p>By flying too close to the sun, Icarus melted the wax from his wings and fell down into the sea where he drowned while he was trying to escape the vengeance of Minos. Icarus's father Daedalus crafted the feathers and wax wings and warned his son to follow his path and not to fly too close to the sun. The myth covers the father-son relationship, the adverse effects of bans and prohibitions as well as the desire of man to always go further, knowing the risks but ignoring them deliberately.
<a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/wax-wings/id623534565">Wax Wings, the fifth album of Joshua Radin</a> shows the artist's hunger for something different. This time, Joshua left his former recording label to release this album with his own efforts and resources which is a risky choice but much rewarding in the end. The result is notably positive, the songs are like introspections into Joshua's personal and fond experiences. This guy is an eternal optimistic poetic lover, he is embracing break-ups with no shame nor reserve and there is always a love tale behind each song.</p>
<p>Globally, the album is a warm good-mood maker collection of stories with both uplifting and catchy tunes like the opening <i>Beautiful Day</i> and heart hurting others such as <i>Like They Used To</i> which uses the Icarus complex to picture a personal break-up <i>&ldquo;I had wax wings and I flew close to you. Now I&rsquo;m falling&rdquo;</i>. </p><div class="iframe-container"><iframe style="height:166px !important;" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F85469643"></iframe></div>]]></content>

        <content type="html" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[<p>Year 2001, studying Art History in Dublin, Lisa Hannigan is 20 years old when she meet Damien Rice in  Whelan's, one of Ireland most famous pubs for their live venues. At that time, Damien is leaving his former band Juniper over musical differences. While working on his debut album, he is looking for a female voice to support his songs and so she starts performing with him.</p>
<p>A year later, the album O is released. The quality of each song is remarkable, breaking away from a conventional band formula with a fantastic cello by Vyvienne Long, piano by the famous Jean Meunier, an orchestral string arrangement and an Opera singer. The interplay between Damien strong voice and Lisa more tender and fragile  is well shown in the track <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY4IBVolt2w">Volcano</a>. Another track to highlight their coaction is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ1ZL0gBH1M">I Remember</a> starting quietly to build up to an intense ending.</p>
<p>After Damien's second album 9 released in 2006, Lisa is leaving the band to focus on her solo career. Her first solo album Sea Saw, well received by the critics, is quite different from her work on O or 9. It sounds more uplifting with cheerful melodies and creative arrangements, the tracks Pistachio or I Don't Know being fine examples. There is something precious about her voice, she can reach both breathy low and strong high keys with perfect control.
Her second album Passenger released in 2011 was sadly a bit disappointing in my opinion as it did not succeed to catch the full power and emotion of her talent, it all sounds impersonal. But still, there are good tracks, my favorites being Paper House and Little Bird.</p>
<p>Here is an acoustic session of I Don't Know shot in an Irish pub in 2008. A really cool performance. </p><div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7WwaPv1rZiQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>]]></content>

        <content type="html" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[<p>From Norway, Erlend &Oslash;ye and Eirik Glambek B&oslash;e form Kings Of Convenience, a perfect duo with subtle guitar melodies and delicate voices. I first heard them in the soundtrack of A Brokedown Melody, a nice 16mm surf documentary directed by Chris Malloy and Jack Johnson. The different locations in this film looks amazing. Mostly shot in South America, Polynesia and Jamaica, there are some beautiful landscapes.<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNuXnKHGVEE">Here is the trailer of the movie</a>.</p>
<p>The Kings's second record Riot On An Empty Street released in 2004 is my favorite. The arrangements with the vocals harmonies, twinkling piano riffs and fine strings are excellent. For most tracks, microphones were placed really close to their mouths and guitar bells which transcribe perfectly every string vibration and finger techniques.</p>
<p>Here is the video for I'd Rather Dance With You, one of the rare more energetic song of this album.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22546159" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Other than that, &Oslash;ye is also into electronic music, he released a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UYjyiZVoc">solo album</a> and toured as a DJ singing along his own mixes. On top of that, he is also the singer and guitarist of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvxi0l8eKkg">The Whitest Boy Alive</a>, originally perceived as an electronic band but  they "slowly developed into a band without any programmed elements" as they say themselves.></a></p>]]></content>

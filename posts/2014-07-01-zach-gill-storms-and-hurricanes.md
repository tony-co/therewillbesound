---

With such as cheerful personality, nothing seems to let this guy down. Zach grew up in a rich musical environment, his grandmother was a Church organist and his father was an ex-rocker. Mainly playing piano and vintage organ, he also plays ukulele, accordion, melodica. He became friends with Dan Lebowitz and Steve Adams in high school to form the [Animal Liberation Orchestra](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/alo/id121829714) which is still performing today. He is also a close friend of Jack Johnson who later proposed him to join his band to add a new dimension to his live performances.

Releasing [his first solo album](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/zach-gills-stuff/id285606553) in 2008 on [Brushfire Records](http://brushfirerecords.com), *the record label of Jack Johnson*, he recorded a collection of stories and reflections on his personal life and experiences. The album is full of bright, joy and optimism with uplifting piano melodies and the warm of his very own voice.

Here is an exclusive solo performance with a nice short and interesting introduction to the song.

From Norway, Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambek Bøe form Kings Of Convenience, a perfect duo with subtle guitar melodies and delicate voices. I first heard them in the soundtrack of A Brokedown Melody, a nice 16mm surf documentary directed by Chris Malloy and Jack Johnson. The different locations in this film looks amazing. Mostly shot in South America, Polynesia and Jamaica, there are some beautiful landscapes.<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNuXnKHGVEE">Here is the trailer of the movie</a>.

The Kings's second record Riot On An Empty Street released in 2004 is my favorite. The arrangements with the vocals harmonies, twinkling piano riffs and fine strings are excellent. For most tracks, microphones were placed really close to their mouths and guitar bells which transcribe perfectly every string vibration and finger techniques.

Here is the video for I'd Rather Dance With You, one of the rare more energetic song of this album.

Other than that, Øye is also into electronic music, he released a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UYjyiZVoc">solo album</a> and toured as a DJ singing along his own mixes. On top of that, he is also the singer and guitarist of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvxi0l8eKkg">The Whitest Boy Alive</a>, originally perceived as an electronic band but  they "slowly developed into a band without any programmed elements" as they say themselves.

title: Jason Reeves & Colbie Caillat - Magic
---

It's been a long time but I am glad to write something new and this one is kind of a storybook. Growing up in Iowa until the age of 21, Jason Reeves flies to Los Angeles California to work with Mikal Blue, a producer offering him to record some tracks to release an EP. Over there, Blue introduced him to Colbie Caillat as he thought there was a common ground between the two individuals.They hit it off really well and he is invited so stay at Caillat's family place while he records his EP Hearths Are Magnets with Blue. His stay eventually became permanent as he decided to stay and not return to Iowa right after his record as the plan was.

While recording the EP, Reeves and Caillat started hanging out, co-writing songs and playing local venues. They are truly comfortable writing together. After the EP was released, they kept writing songs and most of them became Caillat's first album Coco in which 10 of the 12 tracks were cowritten with Reeves. This video is the first song they wrote together, it was filmed back in 2009 while driving down the Malibu coast at sunset.

Since then, Colbie Caillat has been touring a lot and gaining much reputation all around the world, she is now in the studios for her fifth album. Reeves left California to settle down in Tennessee but of course he is often back in L.A. and he has now released his third album. I have seen both of them live but at their own show, Caillat in Paris in 2008 and Reeves in Nottingham in 2010.

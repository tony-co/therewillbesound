title: Joshua Radin - Wax Wings
---

By flying too close to the sun, Icarus melted the wax from his wings and fell down into the sea where he drowned while he was trying to escape the vengeance of Minos. Icarus's father Daedalus crafted the feathers and wax wings and warned his son to follow his path and not to fly too close to the sun. The myth covers the father-son relationship, the adverse effects of bans and prohibitions as well as the desire of man to always go further, knowing the risks but ignoring them deliberately.
<a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/wax-wings/id623534565">Wax Wings, the fifth album of Joshua Radin</a> shows the artist's hunger for something different. This time, Joshua left his former recording label to release this album with his own efforts and resources which is a risky choice but much rewarding in the end. The result is notably positive, the songs are like introspections into Joshua's personal and fond experiences. This guy is an eternal optimistic poetic lover, he is embracing break-ups with no shame nor reserve and there is always a love tale behind each song.

Globally, the album is a warm good-mood maker collection of stories with both uplifting and catchy tunes like the opening <i>Beautiful Day</i> and heart hurting others such as <i>Like They Used To</i> which uses the Icarus complex to picture a personal break-up <i>“I had wax wings and I flew close to you. Now I’m falling”</i>. <div class="iframe-container"><iframe style="height:166px !important;" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F85469643"></iframe></div>

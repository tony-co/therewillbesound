title:  Lisa Hannigan - I Don't Know
---

Year 2001, studying Art History in Dublin, Lisa Hannigan is 20 years old when she meet Damien Rice in  Whelan's, one of Ireland most famous pubs for their live venues. At that time, Damien is leaving his former band Juniper over musical differences. While working on his debut album, he is looking for a female voice to support his songs and so she starts performing with him.

A year later, the album O is released. The quality of each song is remarkable, breaking away from a conventional band formula with a fantastic cello by Vyvienne Long, piano by the famous Jean Meunier, an orchestral string arrangement and an Opera singer. The interplay between Damien strong voice and Lisa more tender and fragile  is well shown in the track <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY4IBVolt2w">Volcano</a>. Another track to highlight their coaction is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ1ZL0gBH1M">I Remember</a> starting quietly to build up to an intense ending.

After Damien's second album 9 released in 2006, Lisa is leaving the band to focus on her solo career. Her first solo album Sea Saw, well received by the critics, is quite different from her work on O or 9. It sounds more uplifting with cheerful melodies and creative arrangements, the tracks Pistachio or I Don't Know being fine examples. There is something precious about her voice, she can reach both breathy low and strong high keys with perfect control.
Her second album Passenger released in 2011 was sadly a bit disappointing in my opinion as it did not succeed to catch the full power and emotion of her talent, it all sounds impersonal. But still, there are good tracks, my favorites being Paper House and Little Bird.

Here is an acoustic session of I Don't Know shot in an Irish pub in 2008. A really cool performance. <div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7WwaPv1rZiQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
